Attack ideas:
	doesn't attack you but attacks your hp directly and you have to do minigame to distract them / keep them from attacking your hp
	interacts with ui in some way (freezes the timer at the bottom / throws your hearts at you / erases your points if you get hit / etc.)
	attack that is two walls on left and right and both walls move left and right at same time
	enemy dashes at player, leaves trail of non-moving circles. Player will have to dodge the enemy dashing at them, then dodge the trail the enemy leaves.
	something like player leaves trail and if player hits own trail then they take damage (like snake)
