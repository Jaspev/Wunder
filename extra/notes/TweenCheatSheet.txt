transition types:
	TRANS_LINEAR	The animation is interpolated linearly.
	TRANS_SINE		The animation is interpolated using a sine function.
	TRANS_QUINT		The animation is interpolated with a quintic (to the power of 5) function.
	TRANS_QUART		The animation is interpolated with a quartic (to the power of 4) function.
	TRANS_QUAD		The animation is interpolated with a quadratic (to the power of 2) function.
	TRANS_EXPO		The animation is interpolated with an exponential (to the power of x) function.
	TRANS_ELASTIC	The animation is interpolated with elasticity, wiggling around the edges.
	TRANS_CUBIC		The animation is interpolated with a cubic (to the power of 3) function.
	TRANS_CIRC		The animation is interpolated with a function using square roots.
	TRANS_BOUNCE	The animation is interpolated by bouncing at the end.
	TRANS_BACK		The animation is interpolated backing out at ends.

easing modes:
	EASE_IN			The interpolation starts slowly and speeds up towards the end.
	EASE_OUT		The interpolation starts quickly and slows down towards the end.
	EASE_IN_OUT		A combination of EASE_IN and EASE_OUT. The interpolation is slowest at both ends.
	EASE_OUT_IN		A combination of EASE_IN and EASE_OUT. The interpolation is fastest at both ends.
