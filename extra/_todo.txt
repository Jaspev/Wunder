bugs:
	player can still move after door starts to close
		cause player is now in enemy scenes not main
	everything about the items
	when on death screen and press quit, doors automatically close on title screen (sometimes??)
	skip item can skip bosses
	if you change settings, they don't save
		solution: save file? Put options vars in global script
	if door transition is interrupted it looks jank
	
optimizations:
	you can just stay in the top right of the flower attack and won't get hit
	replace some functions with func _Input() where it is needed
	rework usable items so they're not all just in the Global script
	figure out why player movement is stuttering sometimes??
	
additions:
	enemies:
		Eye guy attack
		Ghost magician attack
	save file:
		save options menu changes
	debug menu stuff:
		activate _debug_stuff() func by typing "debug" or something in main menu
		on start menu, button that shows all enemies, click which enemy you want to load
			or: make command line https://youtu.be/xhZ3FWUkhKY
	difficulty selection:
		like osu mod selector: double enemy, smaller playfield, 1hp, half player speed, flashlight, double enemy speed, player is 2x size, etc.
	door close animation on player death
	add door close animation to game over screen when you press restart
	different door close/open animations and textures for boss/enemy/shop
	enemies have multiple attacks that are randomly selected (bosses attacks are the same every time)

revisions:
	rework how items work
		Currently:
			it stores all item scripts in the global script and assigns a number to those scripts. When the player buys an Item, it just gives that item's number to the player.
		Should be: 
			Item scripts and id in the item somehow, for organization.

!!!more items / enemies!!!
